# Distributed-Systems
Implementation of Distributed Systems through programming using C &amp; Java.

1. Installation, configuration and Administration of HADOOP, Develop front-end for the same. Develop Name Node, Tracker Node, and Data Nodes (3 to 4 Computers) in loosely coupled Clusters.

2. Program to create socket to communicate between two process and remote procedure Should read all the ports of the remote machine.

3. Used the RPC concept to define the operations on one machine and use those on remotely Placed machine’s application.

4. Used the RMI concept to define the operations on one machine and use those on remotely Placed machine’s application.

5. A multi-threaded Echo server application which will use the above communication mechanism.

6. Program to simulate election algorithm to count votes; in a loosely coupled distributed System few machines will act as a voting machines connected to server. For the synchronization using following method
a. Ring Algorithm
b.Bully’s Algorithm

7. Program for synchronization of logical clock using Lamport’s algorithm.
